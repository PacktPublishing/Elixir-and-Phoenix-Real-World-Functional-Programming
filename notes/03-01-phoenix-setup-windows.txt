# Installing Phoenix on Windows 

First, make sure you have Elixir installed -- which you should if you are following this course from the start. 

Then, let's go ahead and set up the requirements for Phoenix. 

## Install Postgres 

First, install Postgres by downloading it from here: 

https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

The latest version is recommended. Choose your Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit). Download and install using the wizard. 

**When asked for the password, just set it to "postgres"**

## Install Node.js 
Download and install Node's Long Term Support (LTS) version from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Install using the wizard. Default work fine. 

## Setting Up Phoenix 

Open the command prompt and issue the following commands. 

```bash 
mix local.hex 
mix local.rebar --force

mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phx_new.ez 

mkdir elixir-phoenix 
cd elixir-phoenix
mix phx.new hello 

cd hello
mix deps.get 
mix ecto.create 

cd assets 
npm install 
cd .. 

mix phx.server 
```

Then, open your browser to http://localhost:4000/ to see the Phoenix welcome page.
