## Branching with Cond, If and Unless 

The basics can be covered with an if. 

```elixir 
age = 18
if age >= 18 do 
    "Can drive!" 
else 
    "Nope" 
end 

# Can rewrite this as: 

if age >= 18,   do: "Can drive!",   else: "Nope." 
# Notice the commas 
```

We also have cond. 

```elixir 
cond do
    2 + 2 == 5 ->
        "This will not be true"
    2 * 2 == 3 ->
        "Nor this"
    1 + 1 == 2 ->
        "But this will"
end
```

## Unless 

In elixir, there is a shortcut for `if not` -- It's called `unless`. 

```elixir 
age = 16
unless age > 18 do
    "You can't drive, man!"
end

# Also note the `nil` when we change age to 20
```
