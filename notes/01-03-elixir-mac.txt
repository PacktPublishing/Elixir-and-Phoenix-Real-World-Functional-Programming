# Set Up Elixir on MacOS 


If you don't already have homebrew (https://brew.sh), install that: 

```bash 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, go ahead and install elixir using that: 

```bash 
brew install elixir
```

## Running Elixir 

Now that we have elixir set up, let's make sure it's working correctly. 

```bash 
# Getting started with Elixir. 
# Just type: 
#      iex 
# to enter the interactive shell 
```

And here's the hello world for it! 

```elixir 
IO.puts "Hello World!" 
```
