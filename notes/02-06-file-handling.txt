# File Handling 

Basic file handling is easy. Let's see. 

```elixir 
# iex 

{:ok, file} = File.open "hello", [:write]
IO.binwrite file, "world"
File.close file    # Notice that we don't have file.close 

# Let's read it back 

{ok, contents} = File.read "hello"

# Now delete the file and then try again
{ok, contents} = File.read "hello"
```

And the usual Path.join works here as well. 

```elixir 
Path.join("foo", "bar")
Path.expand("~/hello")
```
