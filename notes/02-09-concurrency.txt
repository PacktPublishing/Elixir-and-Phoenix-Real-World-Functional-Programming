# Concurrency in Elixir 

Elixir is famous for its concurrency. Fortunately, it's very easy to work with threads in Elixir and the VM takes care of everything for us itself. 

Let's take a basic example for this. 

```elixir 
# File: 09threads.ex

defmodule Server do 
    def listen do
        receive do 
            {:ok, :ping} -> IO.puts "Pong"
            # {:ok, :ding} -> IO.puts "Dong"
        end 

        listen    # go back to listening 
    end 
end 
```

Let's use this in iex 

```elixir
# load in iex using c("09threads.ex")
pid = spawn(Server, :listen, [])
send pid, {:ok, :ping}
send pid, {:ok, :ding}   # nothing
```
