# Set Up Elixir on Ubuntu  

Let's first set up Elixir. 

```bash
# Set up the repository  

wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install esl-erlang -y 
sudo apt install elixir -y
```

## Running Elixir 

Now that we have elixir set up, let's make sure it's working correctly. 

```bash 
# Getting started with Elixir. 
# Just type: 
#      iex 
# to enter the interactive shell 
```

And here's the hello world for it! 

```elixir 
IO.puts "Hello World!" 
```
