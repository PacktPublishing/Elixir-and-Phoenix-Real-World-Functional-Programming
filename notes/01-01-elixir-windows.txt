# Set Up Elixir on Windows   

Download the installer from https://repo.hex.pm/elixir-websetup.exe

Install it using the wizard. All the default should work fine. 

It might ask you to install some .Net redistributables. Just go ahead and click ok on that as well. 

## Running Elixir 

Now that we have elixir set up, let's make sure it's working correctly. 

Open up the command prompt. 

```bash 
# Getting started with Elixir. 
# Just type: 
#      iex 
# to enter the interactive shell 
```

And here's the hello world for it! 

```elixir 
IO.puts "Hello World!" 
```
